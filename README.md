# Hi there, I am Marco ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in 11/2023 at [coding-bootcamps-eu](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu) and can call myself a Junior Frontend developer.
[Here](https://cbe-concert-compass.netlify.app/) you can find the final project I worked on during the course.

Before I became a frontend developer, I worked as a technician and foreworker/team-leader and successfully studied electrical engineering.
In my previous jobs debugging electrical systems belonged to my daily tasks at work and so I developed a passion for programming ands solving problems.
