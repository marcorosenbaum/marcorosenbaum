# Hi there, I am Marco ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in 11/2023 at [coding-bootcamps-eu](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu) and can call myself a Junior Frontend Developer.
[Here](https://cbe-concert-compass.netlify.app/) you can find the final project I worked on during the course.

Before I became a frontend developer, I worked as a technician and foreworker/team-leader and successfully studied electrical engineering.
In my previous jobs debugging electrical systems belonged to my daily tasks and so I developed a passion for programming and solving problems.

The bootcamp was just a kickoff for me and now I am really excited to dive deeper into the world of coding and learn more about web-development.
